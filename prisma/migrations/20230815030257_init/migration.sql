  Warnings:

  - Made the column `email` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
  - Made the column `password` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
  - Made the column `name` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
  - Changed the type of `role` on the `User` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
